# bin2c
I just figured that might be useful to people.
This program that converts a file file into C char array, like this:

```c
char* file[SIZE]="\x4b\xf\0......\xff\xa5";
```

The executable contains its own source code built into it, just open it with any text editor, scroll down a little bit and you will see it.
